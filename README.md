# Soft Skills Development for Verve Systems Employees

### Introduction
Verve Systems Pvt. Ltd. is an Information Technology Services and Product Development Company located in Ahmedabad, India. The company has many domestic and international clients that the employees in the IT Department have to interact with sometimes. While the IT employees have a high aptitude for technical skills, they lack a proficient level of business acumen. Verve Systems needs help in identifying the business soft skills that the employees need improvement on. 
The primary purpose of this project was to create a quiz for the employees to take individually that would pinpoint the soft skills area that the employee needs improvement in. The questions for the quiz were compiled through consulting various online resources. After creating a quiz, a training recommendation was also requested. The focus of this project however, was to work mainly on the quiz that would identify the employees soft skills proficiency level. Creating or recommending training was a secondary part of the project. The project’s purpose was verified by Verve Systems CEO, Mr. Nitin Bawsay and the HR department head, Ms. Purvi Desai

### Problem Statement

Verve Systems has clients in India and around the globe. Their IT employees are proficient in their work and have advanced technical skills. However, their soft skills need major improvement. IT employees need to incorporate exemplary soft skills when dealing with their international clients. IT employees would come into contact with the clients when making presentations on project deliverables. Verve Systems was also facing issues in making sure group dynamic soft skills for each employee were exemplary to maximize productivity and successful output during projects. Verve systems did not have a system in place they could use to test the soft skills of their employees and work on them. In addition, this module needs to be able to see the weaknesses in potential hires when Verve Systems is interviewing them to join the company. A recommendation needs to be given for the course of action to take in the training of the employees.. Soft skills of employees are a key aspect of a company’s image and in spite of not having much customer interaction, it is integral to develop soft skills. 

### Solution 

1.	Design a web application survey to assess and improve IT employees soft skills. The survey will also be useful for recruitment and hiring new employees.
2.	Assess employees soft skills in the following areas:-	
     * Communication
       * Body language
       * Dealing with international clients
       * Delegation
       * Self-Grooming
     * Stress Handling
     * Responsiveness
3. Provide employees their results and subsequently links to training videos, if required.
4. Provide HR results of the employees. Thus, they can further implement further training for employees and also have a mechanism to assess soft skills for potential IT employees.
